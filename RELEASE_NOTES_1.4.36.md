# Release Notes - unified-video-framework v1.4.36

## 🎯 **Major Fixes & Enhancements**

This release addresses two critical issues identified during development:

### 1. 🔧 **Gateway Configuration & Debugging Improvements**

**Problem**: The paywall controller couldn't properly handle mixed gateway configuration formats, resulting in "Choose a payment method" step not displaying properly.

**Solution**:
- ✅ Enhanced `showGateways()` method with comprehensive debugging logs
- ✅ Added support for PayU gateway alongside Cashfree and Stripe
- ✅ Improved `getLegacyGateway()` method to handle both string and object formats
- ✅ Added proper error handling and user feedback for missing payment methods
- ✅ Better logging throughout the payment flow for easier troubleshooting

**Key Improvements**:
```javascript
// Now supports both formats:
gateways: ['cashfree', 'payu']  // String format
// AND
gateways: [
  {id: 'cashfree', name: 'Cashfree', color: '#00d4aa'},
  {id: 'payu', name: 'PayU', color: '#17bf43'}
]  // Object format
```

### 2. 🔒 **Comprehensive Security Enhancements**

**Problem**: Users could bypass the paywall by using browser dev tools to delete overlay elements and continue playing the video.

**Solution**: Implemented multi-layer security system:

#### **🛡️ Playback Control Security**
- ✅ **`canPlayVideo()`** method validates authentication before allowing playback
- ✅ **Play method** includes security checks that block unauthorized playback  
- ✅ **Seek method** prevents seeking beyond free preview duration without authentication
- ✅ Real-time monitoring of video playback state

#### **👀 Overlay Monitoring System**
- ✅ **Active monitoring** every 1000ms to detect overlay removal attempts
- ✅ **Progressive enforcement**:
  - 1st-2nd attempt: Recreate overlay and warn user
  - 3rd attempt: Trigger security violation protocol
- ✅ **Tamper detection** for overlay visibility, display properties, and DOM presence

#### **🚨 Security Violation Protocol**
- ✅ **Complete video disabling**: Clears video source and hides video element
- ✅ **Tamper-evident interface**: Shows security violation message with page reload option
- ✅ **Prevention of further access attempts**

#### **🔐 Advanced Protection Features**
- ✅ **State management**: Tracks paywall activation, authentication status, and violation attempts
- ✅ **Multi-point validation**: Validates overlay presence, video state, and user authentication
- ✅ **Cleanup integration**: Proper security state reset after successful payment/auth
- ✅ **Developer-friendly**: Debug logging for troubleshooting (when debug mode enabled)

## 📋 **What's New**

### Enhanced PaywallController
- Better debugging with detailed console logs for payment flow troubleshooting
- Improved gateway button rendering with hover effects and proper styling
- Support for mixed gateway configuration formats (backward compatible)
- PayU gateway support added to the legacy gateway definitions

### WebPlayer Security Features
- Comprehensive security monitoring to prevent paywall bypass attempts
- Enhanced playback control with authentication validation
- Progressive security enforcement that escalates with repeated violation attempts
- Proper cleanup and state management for security monitoring

### Developer Experience
- More detailed logging throughout the payment and security systems
- Better error handling and user feedback
- Backward compatible changes that don't break existing implementations

## 🔄 **Migration Notes**

This version is **fully backward compatible**. No changes required for existing implementations.

### Optional Enhancements
If you want to take advantage of the new features:

1. **Enhanced Gateway Configuration**:
```javascript
paywall: {
  enabled: true,
  gateways: [
    {id: 'cashfree', name: 'Cashfree', color: '#00d4aa'},
    {id: 'payu', name: 'PayU', color: '#17bf43'}
  ]
  // ... rest of config
}
```

2. **Debug Mode** (for troubleshooting):
```javascript
const player = new WebPlayer(container, {
  debug: true,  // Enable detailed logging
  // ... rest of config
});
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### Security Implementation
- **Monitoring frequency**: 1000ms intervals (non-intrusive)
- **Violation threshold**: 3 attempts before complete lockdown
- **Recovery method**: Page reload required after security violation
- **Memory management**: Proper cleanup of intervals and event listeners

### Gateway System  
- **Fallback support**: Unknown gateways get auto-generated configurations
- **Color theming**: Custom colors for each payment method
- **Extensible design**: Easy to add new payment gateways

## 📦 **Installation**

```bash
npm install unified-video-framework@1.4.36
```

## 🐛 **Bug Fixes**
- Fixed "Choose a payment method" not displaying when using object gateway configurations
- Fixed paywall bypass vulnerability through DOM manipulation
- Fixed overlay cleanup after successful payment completion
- Improved video playback security and access control

## ⚡ **Performance**
- Optimized security monitoring to run every 1000ms instead of 500ms for better performance
- Efficient overlay detection using modern DOM APIs
- Minimal impact on video playback performance
