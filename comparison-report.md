## 🔧 Recommendations

To make WebPlayer.ts match enhanced-player.html completely:

1. **Add keyboard event listener** in `setupControlsEventListeners()`
2. **Create settings menu** with speed and quality options
3. **Add time tooltip** to progress bar hover
4. **Include PiP button** in controls bar
5. **Add title bar** section with metadata display
6. **Implement cast support** (optional, browser-specific)
7. **Add share functionality** using Web Share API
8. **Include quality badge** in controls
9. **Create shortcut indicator** overlay

## Conclusion

The core functionality and visual design are **mostly matching** between both implementations. WebPlayer.ts has the essential premium UI features but lacks some of the advanced interactive features present in enhanced-player.html. The main differences are:

- WebPlayer.ts focuses on **video format compatibility** (HLS/DASH)
- enhanced-player.html focuses on **user interaction features** (keyboard, sharing, etc.)

Both serve their purposes well, with WebPlayer.ts being more suitable for production use with streaming protocols, while enhanced-player.html provides a richer interactive experience for demonstration purposes.
