## üîß CSS Architecture

### Media Query Strategy
```css
/* Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement */
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) and (orientation: portrait) { /* Mobile portrait */ }
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) and (orientation: landscape) { /* Mobile landscape */ }
@media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1023px) { /* Tablet */ }
@media screen and (min-width: 1024px) { /* Desktop */ }
@media screen and (min-width: 1440px) { /* Ultra-wide */ }

/* Feature-based queries */
@media (hover: none) and (pointer: coarse) { /* Touch devices */ }
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { /* Accessibility */ }
@media (prefers-contrast: high) { /* High contrast */ }
```

### CSS Custom Properties
```css
--uvf-primary-color: #007bff;
--uvf-overlay-strong: rgba(0,0,0,0.95);
--uvf-overlay-medium: rgba(0,0,0,0.7);
--uvf-touch-target-size: 44px;
--uvf-hover-scale: 1.1;
```

/>
```

### Advanced Configuration
